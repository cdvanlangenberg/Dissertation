  abstract = {Abstract Intrinsic random functions (IRF) provide a versatile approach when the assumption of second-order stationarity is not met. Here, we develop the \{IRF\} theory on the circle with its universal kriging application. Unlike \{IRF\} in Euclidean spaces, where differential operations are used to achieve stationarity, our result shows that low-frequency truncation of the Fourier series representation of the \{IRF\} is required for such processes on the circle. All of these features and developments are presented through the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In addition, the connection between kriging and splines is also established, demonstrating their equivalence on the circle. },

  abstract  = {For space-time processes on global or large scales, it is critical to use models that respect the Earth's spherical shape. The covariance functions of such processes should be not only positive definite on sphere × time, but also capable of capturing the dynamics of the processes well. We develop space-time covariance functions on sphere × time that are flexible in producing space-time interactions, especially space-time asymmetries. Our idea is to consider a sum of independent processes in which each process is obtained by applying a first-order differential operator to a fully symmetric process on sphere × time. The resulting covariance functions can produce various types of space-time interactions and give different covariance structures along different latitudes. Our approach yields explicit expressions for the covariance functions, which has great advantages in computation. Moreover, it applies equally well to generating asymmetric space-time covariance functions on flat or other spatial domains. We study various characteristics of our new covariance functions, focusing on their space-time interactions. We apply our model to a dataset of total column ozone levels in the Northern hemisphere.},

  abstract = {It is a matter of common experience that ore values often do not follow the normal (or lognormal) distributions assumed for them, but, instead, follow some other heavier-tailed distribution. In this paper we discuss the robust estimation of the variogram when the distribution is normal-like in the central region but heavier than normal in the tails. It is shown that the use of a fourth-root transformation with or without the use of M-estimation yields stable robust estimates of the variogram.},

They constitute a much wider class than the stationary RF, and are used in practical applications for representing non-stationary phenomena. The most important topics are: existence of a generalized covariance (GC) for which statistical inference is possible from a unique realization; theory of the best linear intrinsic estimator (BLIE) used for contouring and estimating problems; the turning bands method for simulating IRF; and the models with polynomial GC, for which statistical inference may be performed by automatic procedures.},
